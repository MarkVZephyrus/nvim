# My Neovim configuration.
This config uses ```Lazy``` package manager, a pack-man I found to be more intuitive and easier to work with than ```Packer```. When you first launch ```nvim``` with this config it should auto-install ```Lazy``` and all the plugins. An important exception are the ```Mason``` formatters. They are not mentioned in the script anywhere yet so they need to be installed.</br>
For external dependencies, you need ```python```, ```live-grep``` and stuff, I've forgotten, maybe I'll update this section later. If I don't, well there will be nvim errors when you install this and they will inform you. </br>
An important thing to remember is to intall a Nerd Font for a proper icon layout. I currently use JetBrainsMono. Also for themeing this config uses ```pywal``` and ```pywal``` alone, so that should be installed too.</br>
I have picked up a lot of code from all around the internet, if I was to list them all, this would be quite a long list. The youtube channel from Josean Martinez by the same name, helped a lot. I stole a lot of his code. He made my cmp work.

Das ist alle. Enjoy.
